                  Greetings and welcome to my GitHub page! I earned my bachelor's degree in Actuarial Sciences and Financial  Mathematics from the
                  <a href="https://www.upei.ca/school-of-mathematical-and-computational-sciences">School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences</a> 
                  at the University of Prince Edward Island. Building on this foundation, I began my Master of Mathematics (MMath) in 
                  <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/computational-mathematics/">Computational Mathematics</a> at the University of Waterloo in September 2022. 
                </p>
                <p>I am pleased to announce the successful defense and submission of my Master's research paper, marking the completion of my academic journey at the University of Waterloo. 
                  With my studies concluded, I seek opportunities to leverage my skills and knowledge in data science, data analysis, and insurance modeling (climate and weather catastrophe).
                </p>

                <h4>Finance and Actuarial Research:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Using a geometrical approach, I helped develop a new risk measure for buy-and-hold and delta hedge portfolios.</li>
                    <li>I constructed ARIMA time series models to accurately forecast insurance reimbursements for prescribed medications, presenting findings through an interactive RShiny dashboard.</li>
                </ul>
        
                <h4>Climate Change Research:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>I spearheaded a project at the Canadian Centre of Climate Change and  Adaptation, conducting an in-depth analysis of domestic and international climate change policies. 
                      This involved utilizing advanced methodologies such as machine learning, regression models, and similarity metrics to assess the synergy among G7 countries in achieving 
                      Sustainable Development Goals.</li>
                    <li>My Master's research introduced a groundbreaking Loss Layering model, enhancing insurers' risk management by numerically retaining specific loss layers.

                      reducing the amount of risk for insurers.</li>

                <strong>Quantitative Assessment of The Group of Seven's Collaboration in Sustainable Development Goals</strong>:
                <br>
                I'm thrilled to share that my first paper has been published in Nature Communications! After dedicating almost 3 years to this research, 
                it's incredibly rewarding to see this work come to fruition.
                <br> 
                <br> 
                This paper introduces a synergy-based framework for quantitatively 
                assessing international cooperation towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and a detailed breakdown of synergy contribution from individual countries. 
                Our findings identify notable discrepancies and lack of cooperation of G7 countries in achieving environmental SDGs, 
                emphasizing the need for enhanced collaboration to address critical issues like climate change and biodiversity loss.

                  I worked on a project that showcases my ability to constrct Convolutional Neural Network.
                  This personal project tries to promote image classification of Remote Sensing (RS) images through the development and application of a 
                  specialized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the RSI-CB256 dataset. 
                  Comprising 5631 images in JPG format, with varied color representations and majority at 250x250 pixels,the dataset posed challenges including non-uniform RGB formats. 
                  Beyond providing a robust classification model, this work hopes to contribute to the discourse on constructing benchmark model
                  for RS interpretation research, standing as a testament to the nuanced fusion of cutting-edge CNN with the imperative demands of RS image interpretation.

            <strong>Research Projects</strong><br/>
            <ul>
              <li> My Master's research project centered on pioneering Loss Layering model, a transformative framework for insurers to strategically manage risk exposure
              by retaining specific loss layers while transferring higher layers. Our innovative approach involves classifying regional losses 
              into "near maximum" and "near minimum" values, followed by precise layer allocation using non-linear regression. 
              The comprehensive integration of all loss values, not just tail distributions, sets our work apart, providing insurers with a 
              nuanced risk perspective. This framework empowers insurers to strategically allocate assets, diversify risk, and enhance coverage 
              for catastrophic perils, ensuring adaptable responses to evolving climate patterns. Ultimately, my research contributes to 
              reshaping risk management strategies and fortifying insurers' resilience in the face of unprecedented events. Please see my presentation slides 
              for this research project: <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/computational-mathematics/sites/ca.computational-mathematics/files/uploads/files/ali_raisolsadat_university_of_waterloo_masters_essay_2023_finalized.pdf">Risk Layering - A Loss Classification Approach</a>

            In this project, we discussed the issues of probabilistic risk measures, coherence of risk measures, and proposed a geometrical approach to evaluate a "risk-averse" risk measure.</li>
